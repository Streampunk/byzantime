# byzantime
REST API for access to parts of professional media files by media timing reference, mapping between bytes and time, hence _byzantime_.

Currently a quick hack project to see how easy it is to use the Streampunk [kelvinadon](https://github.com/Streampunk/kelvinadon) MXF streaming library to create a REST API for accessing data in an MXF file.
